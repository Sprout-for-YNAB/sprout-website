title: 'Sprout for YNAB Closure'
date: '2024-08-01'
---
I will be shutting down Sprout for YNAB on August 31, 2024. 

## Why?
A lack of interest and motivation for me to continue working on this project, plus a decision to end my YNAB subscription on August 31, 2024.

## What will happen after Sprout for YNAB shuts down?
The extension will be removed from browser stores on or after August 31, 2024, and the authentication server will go offline on August 31, 2024. Without being able to authenticate with YNAB's servers via the authentication server, your Sprout for YNAB extension will eventually stop working.

## For developers
I will open source Sprout for YNAB! Developers who are interested in forking this project will have an opportunity to do so. The parts of Sprout for YNAB include the following:
- Browser Extension
- Authentication Server
- Website

I will also open source a V2 of Sprout for YNAB that I had worked on and had not finished. This V2 was written from scratch with a different communication paradigm from the current version of Sprout for YNAB, and has support for split transactions.

I plan to have these projects open sourced by August 31, 2024. The repos will be on [Sprout for YNAB's GitHub page](https://github.com/Sprout-for-YNAB).

## Thank you
I apologize for the inconvenience this will cause. Thank you for using Sprout for YNAB since its release.
