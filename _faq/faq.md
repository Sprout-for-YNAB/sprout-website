## Features
### Can you schedule transactions?
Unfortunately you cannot schedule transactions in the extension. YNAB's API does not allow apps and extensions to create scheduled transactions. You'll have to go to the YNAB app to schedule a transaction.

### Can you create split transactions?
Not currently, but it's on the roadmap!

## Platform
### Is there a version available for Safari?
There are currently no plans for a Safari version of the extension, but it will be considered.

### Have you considered making Sprout for YNAB open source?
Yes! I would like to open source the extension in the future. Nothing else to announce regarding open source at this time.
